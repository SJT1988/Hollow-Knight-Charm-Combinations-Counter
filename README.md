Quick-and-dirty program that enumerates (counts and lists) all possible charm combinations in Hollow Knight without being "overcharmed" .
According to this solution, there are 4,493,228 combinations of charms possible without exceeding the number of charm notches available (11) and incurring a penalty ("overcharmmed").
This solution is suboptimal, but is just a lark and only only takes a minute or so to complete. The resulting text file, combos.txt, is about 800mb.
I may modifiy this in the future to accomodate "overcharmmed" combinations (combinations exceeding 11 notches). I invite others to try to calculate it before me.
